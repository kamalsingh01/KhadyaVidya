NOTE: django media directory is used to show images on frfontend retrieved from backend.
Media directory is set by updating static rule in settings.py, putting updated values of static root and static url setting
STATIC ROOT is for django admin files and STATIC URL is for HTML, Javascripts and MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL is for all media files like jpeg, png, etc.
All these 4 setting attributes need to be updated and then used for using media files in frontend
STATICFILES_DIR is added so that all the media files get updated in the public/staic folder.
After this we update urls.py with media(public/static) folder so that all the images present at the server are available to the App and we can access all the images using browser.
for production based applications, mainly cdn(content delivery network) or amazon's S3 is used to store all the images and static files, we don't dump files on django server or app.
